Courage and Bravery shown in 'To Kill A Mockingbird'.

'They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.’

Harper Lee presents courage throughout the novel of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' . The story is based in 1930 America when there was a lot of prejudice towards coloured people. It took true courage and bravery to do what some the characters chose to do in this book. Atticus, Mrs. Dubose, and Boo Radley  especially showed many examples of such courage. That is who the essay will be focusing on.

Atticus shows bravery all through the story. He is one of the main characters and probably shows the most courage out of all the people. This is because even though he is called a 'nigger lover' due to the fact he is defending Tom Robinson who was a black   convicted for rape. He undertakes this task without listening to the ridicule and remarks from many of the other characters. Even while enduring all the racism and hate, he did his best to defend Tom and didn't give up. "If I didn't I couldn't hold my head up in town, I couldn't represent this country in legislature, I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do something". This shows his moral is very high and he will help Tom so that he will stop his children from getting abused. Also all through the story he does not resort to fighting even when Scout is defending him. He always tries to find a way round using his brain for instance "You just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don't you let 'em get your goat. Try fightin' with your head for a change.” This would take courage to say because many people would want to fight. Overall Atticus is one of the bravest characters is the novel.

Mrs Dubose is pictured to be a very ratty, annoyed person because she is always shouting and telling people off. We later find that she is actually a morphine addict meaning part of the and anger is to do with this addiction. She then knows she is dying so wants to give up morphine and "She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody". This was a very brave thing to do because it meant she was in a lot of pain and wanted to get rid of it.

Boo Radley is a very mysterious character because we never actually see him but we have seen hints of how he is trying to reach the outside world after thirty years of 'prison'. This is very courageous because thirty years ago he was in trouble with the law and had to stay locked up at home. All through the novel he finds ways to communicate to Scout and Jem. It starts when he notices the children playing outside the house and starts leaving gifts. He leaves things that are his own or important such as Indian coins, soap figures of Scout and Jem, twine and gum. This is very courageous because other people might not believe that he will not be ready to meet everyone again. An even more courageous act of Boo’s was to place blankets over Scout and Jem during the fire of Mrs Maudie’s house. All of this is very courageous especially as he is thought to be a scary man who was very bad. This is very brave of Boo Radley to decide to try and reach out to the open world.

In chapter 10 Atticus is forced to Shoot and kill Harry Johnson's dog Tim Johnson who had gone mad. Atticus had not shot a gun for over thirty years and had hidden his talent for a long time. This was very courageous of him because he didn't want his children to know but had to so that he could kill the dog. this was courageous of him because he had turned away from that path ages ago.

Overall I think that Harper Lee was trying to say that whatever steps into your path you ahould have a go. I think this because Atticus would not turn down from a challenge and would never give up. This is an important trait and I think that the main thing is to give anything a go.
